Format this job interview transcription into clean, readable markdown.

IMPORTANT: Structure the output with clear topic sections using ## (level 2) headers. Each major topic or discussion point should have its own ## header (e.g., "## Introduction", "## Technical Background", "## Project Discussion", "## Closing").

Include:
- Topic sections with ## headers for each major discussion point
- Speaker labels (e.g., **Interviewer**, **Candidate**; use names if available)
- Timestamps if present
- Clear paragraph breaks between speaker turns

The result must contain the original text in full with improved structure and readability.
